# Welcome to ViewTube!

This is my functional clone of YouTube! Although, it is still a work in progress, it has many great functions such as complete user creation and authentication using modern technology. It also features full video playback and storage using Amazon Web Services. I started from scratch using Ruby on Rails on the backend and a React-Redux implementation for the front-end routes and setup. I am using a PostGresSQL databse. Please check out some of the features.

# Features
My app features complete user creation and authentication feature that uses modern Bcrypt technology. It compares password digests and session tokens to ensure secure login by a user. I used API requests from the front-end actions to send user info to the backend User and Sessions controllers to validate a new session for a user.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.
